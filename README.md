## A hyper casual gravity based game

**What will the application do?**

The application is a java based game that puts the player in an enclosed environment. The main goal is for the player 
is to collect "points" that appear around the screen. During this, obstacles appear on the screen from any of the four 
edges of the arena. These obstacles move from one side of the arena across the screen until they make contact with the 
opposite edge. If the player makes contact with these obstacles, the game ends. In order to dodge these the player 
can jump, double jump, and flip the gravity of the entire arena.

**Who will use it?**

The game is focused towards gamers who want a casual, quick paced experience to kill boredom.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

This project is of interest to me as my ultimate goal as a computer science student is to be a game designer. Designing
a casual game such as this will allow me to understand what makes game enjoyable and replayable.
